  PyMongo connects lazily, so the returned client does not perform any

      connection_string: The MongoDB connection string (URI), e.g.
        "mongodb+srv://user:password@cluster.mongodb.net/".
      timeout_ms: Time limit in milliseconds for each operation run through
        this client. Unset leaves PyMongo's default, which is no limit.
